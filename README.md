### ðŸ“Š Summary & Discussion

ðŸ”· Problem Statement
We investigated the relationship between teenage phone addiction and well-being, focusing on how addiction levels relate to academic performance, sleep, exercise, mental health, and social behaviors. Using advanced resampling and inferential techniques, our goal was to uncover not just whether significant associations exist, but what their broader implications may be for adolescent development.
